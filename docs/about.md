    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>I'm Nil Monfort, a computer engineer who loves building systems. I started coding in 2020 while studying automotive engineering. Cars didn't click; code did. I switched to computer science and never looked back. Today I work as an AI engineer at Inditex and I also take on freelance projects.</p>

## What I build

I turn real problems into working software. Lately that means AI systems: smart assistants (agents), search with context (RAG), and cloud infrastructure. My goal is simple: help medium sized companies ship faster and increase revenue.

## A project I’m proud of

In 2025 I built an AI platform for a client’s creative team (retail industry). Before, going from idea to print-ready mockups was slow. I built a workflow that turns a short brief into several options, pulls brand colors and logos, saves clean metadata to their CRM, and can run drafts overnight with short notes. Result: much faster cycles (about 5x faster from concept to mockup and 30% fewer revisions).

## My edge

I span software and applied AI. I moved from early web work into backend and machine learning, which is where I’m happiest. I use clean, simple designs and I can ship end to end in the cloud. I hold the AWS Solutions Architect Associate and I like serverless because it is fast and cost friendly. I also enjoy the business side: talking to users, finding the real need, and tying tech to results.

## How I work

I start by clarifying the problem. Then I ship in small, usable slices that work from end to end. Each slice has tests, simple evals for AI parts, and basic logs and checks so we can move fast without breaking things. Keep it simple, easy to maintain, and easy to roll back. I use Cursor for speed and PyCharm when I need to dig into a tricky bug.

## My techie path

I learned the basics in a Python class and switched my major soon after. I worked frontend at a startup and learned AWS, then moved to backend and ML, algorithms, the good stuff. Later I did data engineering, which sharpened my system thinking, but I missed daily coding. Now at Inditex I work on RAG and agent systems, and I still get the same kick from shipping real things.

## Beyond code

I’m big on movement: surf when the Mediterranean has waves (not often, haha), gym, calisthenics, and some martial arts. Hard training balances the hard thinking at work and makes me sharper. I care about self improvement and try to be the best version of myself.


## Work with me

I help identify where tech can improve your business and turn that into results.
