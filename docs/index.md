### [Ship Faster Without Breaking Your Agent](/writing/2025/01/20/ship-faster-without-breaking-your-agent/)

*A tiny evaluator that catches prompt drift and tool bugs before your users do.*

Every time I changed my agent's prompt or a tool description, something else broke. Tool B started working and Tool A began to hallucinate. Rolling back and retesting by hand was slow and noisy. I needed a quick truth check I could run on every change.

### [From Taxi Allocation to LLM Validation: My Journey in AI Engineering](/writing/2025/01/15/from-taxi-allocation-to-llm-validation-my-journey-in-ai-engineering/)

Looking back at my journey from developing taxi allocation algorithms to building LLM validation systems, I've learned that AI engineering is as much about solving real-world problems as it is about understanding the latest models and frameworks.

### [Building Production-Ready RAG Systems with Hexagonal Architecture](/writing/2025/01/01/building-production-ready-rag-systems-with-hexagonal-architecture/)

Building production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems requires more than just connecting a vector database to an LLM. After leading the development of a multi-tenant RAG platform at Inditex, I've learned valuable lessons about architecture, scalability, and reliability.
